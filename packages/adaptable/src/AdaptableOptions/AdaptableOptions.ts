/**
 * `AdaptableOptions` provides all the layout, DataGrid, config and other information required to ensure a full, rich user experience.
 *
 * This is the only object created that AdapTable requires to initialise and run; it is set up by developers at design-time and injected into the AdapTable constructor at startup.
 *
 * The `AdaptableOptions` class contains a few regular properties of which 2 (`vendorGrid` and `primaryKey`) are mandatory - and a number of `xxxOptions` properties where the type is itself a collection of related properties.
 *
 * Typically users will only populate a few of the properties in `AdaptableOptions`, and only a few properties in each class.
 *
 * Any property that is not supplied by the user when populating the object, will use the default value (which is listed here for each property).
 *
 * All properties are optional with the exception of `primaryKey` and `vendorGrid`
 *
 * The current contents of `AdaptableOptions` are:
 *

   * Each Audit message is a combination of an `AuditTrigger` and an `AuditDestination`, and packaged as a simple JSON object.
   *
   * You can set as many AuditTriggers as you want, and for each `AuditTrigger`, select as many AuditDestinations as you require.
   *
   * The 5 Audit Triggers are:
   *
   * - **CellEdit**: whenever a cell in AdapTable is changed as a result of user action
   *
   * - **TickingDataUpdate**: whenever the data in AdapTable is updated as a result of external action
   *
   * - **FunctionEvent**: whenever an AdapTable function is run (e.g. Quick Search, Smart Edit, Export)
   *
   * - **UserStateChange**: whenever a change is made to the User's state (e.g. selected a new layout)
   *
   * - **InternalStateChange**: whenever a change is made to AdapTable's internal state (e.g. new cells selected)
   *
   * The 4 possible Audit Destinations are:
   *
   * - **Http Channel**: If you choose this then you need to set up the channel, on which you can subsequently listen to Audit messages using your own internal reporting software (e.g. he Elastic Stack).
   *
   * - **Console**: Audits messages to the console - useful for testing, support and debug purposes
   *
   * - **Alert**: If you set this option for any Trigger, then you can should also choose the Type (e.g. 'Success', 'Info' etc) and whether to show it as a Popup.
   *
   * - **Event**: If selected, you will be able to listen to the the `Audit Event` using the {@link AuditEventApi|Audit Event API}
