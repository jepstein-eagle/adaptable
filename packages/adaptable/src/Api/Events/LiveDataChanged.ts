/**
 * The Event Args used as part of the **on('LiveDataChanged')** event.
 *
 * This event is fired whenever OpenFin, Glue42 or ipushpull is connected or disconnected.
 *
 * It is also fired whenever a `Live Report` is started, stopped or updated.
 *
 * The main property is the [`LiveDataChangedInfo`](_src_api_events_LiveDataChanged_.LiveDataChangedinfo.html)
 *
 * Adaptable uses [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org/) so you access the object using [FDC3 Context Data Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/1.0/context-spec) (e.g xxx.data[0].id;)
 *
 *  **Example: Subscribing to the 'LiveDataChanged' event**
 *
 * ```ts
 * adaptableApi.eventApi.on(
 *    'LiveDataChanged',
 *      (eventArgs: LiveDataChangedEventArgs) => {
 *        let liveDataChangedInfo: LiveDataChangedInfo = eventArgs.data[0].id;
 *        // do something...
 *   }
 *  );
 * ```

 *
 * The event fires when a partner which uses Live Data is connected or disconnected, or a LiveReport is started, stopped or updated.
 *
 * The object contains 3 properties:
 *
 * - The `LiveDataTrigger` property defines **why** the event fired.
 *
 * - The `ReportDestination` property reflects which of Adaptable Partners is being used (i.e. OpenFin, ipushpull or Glue42).
 *
 * - The `LiveReport` property provides details of the Report that has just been stopped / started / updated.
