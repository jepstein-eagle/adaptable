/**
 * The Predefined Configuration for the Application function
 *
 * The Application function is designed to allow developers to provide Adaptable with appliation-specific data.
 *
 * In previous version, Application State included an ApplicationToolbar for users to render application-specific content, but this has now been removed and you should use [Custom Toolbars](_src_predefinedconfig_dashboardstate_.dashboardstate.html#customtoolbars) in Dashboard State instead.

 *
 * **Application Data Entries**
 *
 * The `ApplicationDataEntries` array enables you to provide Adaptable with your own data (which needs to be provided in key / value form) that Adaptable will then store in its State.
 *
 *  **Note** Because these entries are stored as JSON, the value must be something that is capable of being 'stringified'.
 *
 * **Application Data Entries Predefined Config Example**
 *
 *  ```ts
 * export default {
 * Application: {
 *  ApplicationDataEntries:[
 *    {
 *      Key: 'Name',
 *      Value: 'John Smith',
 *    },
 *    {
 *      Key: 'Employee Number',
 *      Value: 20283728,
 *    },
 *    {
 *      Key: 'Joined Date',
 *      Value: new Date(2017, 13, 7),
 *    },
 *    {
 *      Key: 'Super User',
 *      Value: false,
 *    },
 *    ],
 *  }
 * } as PredefinedConfig;
 * ```
