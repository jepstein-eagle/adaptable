/**
 * The Predefined Configuration for the Custom Sort function
 *
 * Use Custom Sort when you want to sort a column in non default ways (i.e. not alphabetically or not in natural ascending / descending order).
 *
 * Custom Sorts will be applied both when you sort the Column in table view and in pivot view.
 *
 * When creating a Custom Sort you can set the sort in one of 2 ways:
 *
 * - Through `SortedValues` - a sorted list of column values which will be evaluated according to the list order (any item not in the list is sorted 'naturally' after all the values in the list have been sorted)
 *
 * - Through the `CustomSortComparerFunction` - a standard 'Comparer' function provided by you.

 * **Custom Sort Predefined Config Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * export default {
 * CustomSort: {
 *   CustomSorts: [
 *     {
 *       ColumnId: 'Rating',
 *       SortedValues: ['AAA', 'AA+', 'AA', 'AA-'], // etc.
 *     },
 *     {
 *        ColumnId: 'Country',
 *        CustomSortComparerFunction:
 *          (valueA: any, valueB: any, nodeA: any, nodeB: any) => {
 *            if (valueA === 'United Kingdom') {
 *              return -1;
 *            }
 *            if (valueB === 'United Kingdom') {
 *              return 1;
 *            }
 *            return nodeA.data.notional > nodeB.data.notional ? 1 : -1;
 *          },
 *      },
 *   ],
 * },
 * } as PredefinedConfig;
 * ```
 * In this example we have created 2 Custom Sorts:
 *
 * - One on the Rating Column - which will use the list (and order) we have provided
 *
 * - One on the Country Column - which will use a function that will sort as follows: first it will show cells with the value of 'United Kingdom', and the remaining cells in the column will sort according to the value in Notional column for that row.
