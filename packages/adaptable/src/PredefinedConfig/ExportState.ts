/**
 * The Predefined Configuration for the Export function
 *
 * Export enables you to create saveable Reports that you can run either manually or on a schedule.
 *
 * Adaptable will popuplate the Export dropdown with your reports and allow you to export the data to a number of destinations.
 *
 * Each Report has both Row and Column Scope to allow you define which Rows and Columns are contained in the Export
 *
 *  * **Export Predefined Config Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 * Export: {
 *    Reports: [
 *      {
 *        Name: 'End of Day',
 *        ColumnIds: [
 *          'bid',
 *          'counterparty',
 *          'currency',
 *          'tradeDate',
 *          'settlementDate',
 *          'ask',
 *          'moodysRating',
 *          'bloombergBid',
 *          'bloombergAsk',
 *       ],
 *        ReportColumnScope: 'BespokeColumns',
 *        ReportRowScope: 'VisibleRows',
 *        ExportDestination: 'JSON',
 *       },
 *      },
 *    ],
 *    CurrentReport: 'End of Day',
 *  },
 * } as PredefinedConfig;
