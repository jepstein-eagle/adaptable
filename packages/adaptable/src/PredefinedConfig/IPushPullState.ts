/**
 * The objects required to run the [ipushpull](https://ipushpull.com) integration from within Adaptable.
 *
 * This state is created by the user / developer at design time and injected into Adaptable as Predefined Config.
 *
 * Our partnership with ipushpull enables you to send live data from AdapTable to a number of locations, including Symphony.
 *
 *  **Further AdapTable Help Resources**
 *
 * [Demo Site](https://demo.adaptabletools.com/partners/ipushpulldemo/) | [ipushpull API](_src_api_ipushpullapi_.ipushpullapi.html) | [ipushpull Function Read Me](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/functions/ipushpull-function.md)
 *
 * If ipushpull state is provided, then AdapTable will set the `IsIPushPullAvailable` property to true (you can get the value of this property through the iPushPullApi [isIPushPullAvailable](_src_api_ipushpullapi_.ipushpullapi.html#isipushpullavailable) function)
 *
 * When this property is set to true, an ipushpull Toolbar will be for you to use.
 *
 * If you have `AutoLogin` set to true then AdapTable will try to log you in automatically; otherwise the toolbar will display a login button that when clicked will open the Login popup.
 *
 * Once you are logged in another boolean property (`IsIPushPullRunning`) is set to true (you can get the value of this property through the iPushPullApi [isIPushPullRunning](_src_api_ipushpullapi_.ipushpullapi.html#isipushpullrunning) function)
 *
 * Within the ipushpull Toolbar there are options to:
 *
 * - Send a Snapshot (one-off) report to ipushpull
 *
 * - Send 'Live Data' to ipushpull so that it updates in line with changes in AdapTable
 *
 * - Create a schedule so that data will get exported to ipushpull at a particular (and repeated) time / date
 *
 * - Add a new ipushpull page
 *
 * To use ipushpull you will need to have your own ipushpull username and login credentials.
 *
 * However you will automatically use AdapTable's credentials (i.e. the `api_secret` and `api_key` properties), so please **always use the config as set in the example below**.
 *
 * **ipushpull Predefined Config Example**
 *
 *  ```ts
 *
 *  // 1. import ipushpull into your harness / application using the ipushpull dependency (which you will need to add your package.json)
 *  import ipushpull from 'ipushpull-js';
 *
 *  ------
 *
 * // 2. immediately thereafter set the config for the ipushpull object as follows:
 * // (note: we will  add the real values for the `api_secret` & `api_key` properties)
 *  ipushpull.config.set({
 *    api_secret: '',  // will be added by Adaptable
 *    api_key: '',     // will be added by Adaptable
 *    api_url: 'https://www.ipushpull.com/api/1.0',
 *    ws_url: 'https://www.ipushpull.com',
 *    web_url: 'https://www.ipushpull.com',
 *    docs_url: 'https://docs.ipushpull.com',
 *    storage_prefix: 'ipp_local',
 *    transport: 'polling',
 *    hsts: false, // strict cors policy
 * });
 *
 *  ------
 *
 * // 3. pass in this config as 'iPushPullInstance' property in ipushpull state
 * // You can add your ipushpull username & password to help pre-fill the login page
 * const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
 *   .........
 *   predefinedConfig: {
 *      IPushPull: {
 *        iPushPullInstance: ipushpull,  // object created above
 *        Username: [YOUR IPUSHPULL USERNAME], // optional, saves being keyed each time
 *        Password: [YOUR IPUSHPULL PASSWORD], // optional, save sbeing keyed each time
 *        ThrottleTime: 5000,
 *        AutoLogin: true,
 *      },
 *    },
 *  };
 * }
 *
 *  ```
 * You are also able to listen to ipushpull-related changes by subscribing to the `LiveDataChanged` event (learn more [here](_src_api_events_livedatachanged_.livedatachangedinfo.html) ).
 *
 * This event contains a `ReportDestination` property which you can check to see whether it equals 'iPushPull'.
 *
 * The event also includes a `LiveDataTrigger` property which will tell you what caused the event to fire (e.g. connected, dataupdated etc.), and a `LiveReport` property which provides the report affected.
 *
 *  **Example: Subscribing to the 'LiveDataChanged' event**
 *
 * ```ts
 * adaptableApi.eventApi.on(
 *    'LiveDataChanged',
 *      (eventArgs: LiveDataChangedEventArgs) => {
 *        let liveDataChangedInfo: LiveDataChangedInfo = eventArgs.data[0].id;
 *         if (liveDataChangedInfo.ReportDestination == 'iPushPull') {
 *            if(liveDataChangedInfo.LiveDataTrigger==='LiveDataStarted'){
 *              const iPushPullReport: IPushPullReport = liveDataChangedInfo.LiveReport;
 *              // do somthing wih the report...
 *            }
 *        }
 *    }
 *  );
 * ```
 *
