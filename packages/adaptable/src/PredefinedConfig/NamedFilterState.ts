/**
 * Named Filters are filters provided at run-time together with a Predicate Function that will be evaluated each time the Filter runs.
 *
 * The Predicate Function will be given 3 params:
 *
 * a. *record* - the row where the Named Filter will be applied
 *
 * b. *columnId* - the column which contains the Named Filter
 *
 * c.  *cellValue* - the value being tested
 *
 * **Named Filter Predefined Config Example**
 *
 * ```ts
 *
 * export default {
 *  NamedFilter: {
 *   NamedFilters: [
 *     {
 *       Name: '$ Trades',
 *       Scope: {
 *         DataType: 'Number',
 *         ColumnIds: ['currency'],
 *       },
 *       FilterPredicate: (_record, _columnId, cellValue) => {
 *         return cellValue === 'USD';
 *       },
 *     },
 *     {
 *       Name: 'Biz Year',
 *       Scope: {
 *         DataType: 'Date',
 *       },
 *       FilterPredicate: (_record, _columnId, cellValue) => {
 *         let dateToTest = cellValue as Date;
 *         let startBusinesssYear = new Date('2019-04-05');
 *         return dateToTest > startBusinesssYear;
 *       },
 *      },
 *   ],
 * },
 * } as PredefinedConfig;
 * ```
