# adaptable (core)

Repository for the 'Core' AdapTable package - developed by Adaptable Tools.

There are also [React](../../packages/adaptable-react-aggrid)
and [Angular](../../packages/adaptable-ng-aggrid) Wrappers available for those who wish to access AdapTable (when running with ag-Grid) using their preferred Framework.

## Upgrade Guide

Version 6 of AdapTable has introduced many new functionality and upgrades and also some new, exciting, ways of interacting with the product.  

For more information please see the [Version 6 Upgrade Guide](../../packages/adaptable/readme/upgrade-guides/upgrade-guide-v6.md)

## Installation

AdapTable is distributed via the private npm registry [https://registry.adaptabletools.com](https://registry.adaptabletools.com).

To gain access to this registry please follow these steps:

1. Acquire a commercial AdapTable License - you can email [`support@adaptabletools.com`](mailto:support@adaptabletools.com) who will provide you with your unique credentials.

2. Point your npm client to the correct registry for packages under the `@adaptabletools` scope

    ```npm config set @adaptabletools:registry https://registry.adaptabletools.com```

    if you're using yarn

    ```yarn config set @adaptabletools:registry https://registry.adaptabletools.com```

3. Login to the AdapTable private registry:

    ```sh
    npm login --registry=https://registry.adaptabletools.com --scope=@adaptabletools
    ```

4. Enter the credentials that were provided to you by the AdapTable support team:

    * login name
    * email
    * password
  
5. Check you are logged-in correctly by using whoami:

    ```
    npm whoami --registry=https://registry.adaptabletools.com
    ```

    This should display the username you received as the current login on the private registry

    **note: this does not affect your username/login session on the public npm registry**

6. Install AdapTable

    ```npm i @adaptabletools/adaptable```

7. Make sure that all the Peer Dependencies are installed. These is currently just **@ag-grid-community/all-modules**:

    ```
    "peerDependencies": {
        "@ag-grid-community/all-modules": "^22.1.1",
    }
    ```
    
## Plugins
AdapTable now includes plugins to reduce the download size of the 'core' project and to allow you to select only the functionality you want.  

There are currently 3 plugins:

- **Charts** (`@adaptabletools/adaptable-charts-finance`)

  > courtesy of Infragistics - provides Category, Pie, Doughnut, Sparkline and Financial charts.  

- **Finance** (`@adaptabletools/adaptable-plugin-finance`)

  > adds additional functionality of benefit only to advanced financial users.

- **NoCode** (`@adaptabletools/adaptable-plugin-nocode-aggrid`)

  > enables the creation of dynamic AdapTable instances by dragging and droppping JSON or Excel files.

#### Plugins Example
To add a plugin you need to do the following 3 steps (using the `charts` plugin as an example):

1. Install the plugin as a separate package:

    ```npm i @adaptabletools/adaptable-plugin-charts```

2. Import it into your code:

    ```import charts from '@adaptable/adaptable-plugins-charts'```

3. Add it to the `plugins` property of *AdaptableOptions*:

    ```tsx
    const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
      primaryKey: 'tradeId',
      adaptableId: 'Adaptable demo',
      ....
      plugins: [charts()]
    };
    ```

## agGrid Enterprise Modules
AdapTable uses ag-Grid v.22.  This included a big change by introducing [modularization](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-modules/), giving users more control over which functionality they want to use.  AdapTable fully supports this new way of working.

**If using any ag-Grid Enterprise modules, please make sure you have a valid ag-Grid licence**

#### Enterprise Modules Example
To add an ag-Grid Enterprise follow these 3 steps (using Menus and RangeSelection as an example):

1. Install the modules in npm:

    ```
    npm i @ag-grid-enterprise/menu
    npm i @ag-grid-enterprise/range-selection
    ```

2. Import them into your code:

    ```
    import { MenuModule } from '@ag-grid-enterprise/menu';
    import { RangeSelectionModule } from '@ag-grid-enterprise/range-selection';
    ```

3. Add them to the **vendorGrid** propety in *AdaptableOptions* using the **modules** property

    ```tsx
      const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
        primaryKey: 'tradeId',
        adaptableId: 'Modules Demo',
        vendorGrid: {
          ...gridOptions,
          modules: [MenuModule, RangeSelectionModule],
        },
        ....
      };
    ```

## Styling and Theming

AdapTable provides 2 default themes ('Light' and 'Dark') but you can easily create your own custom themes (by using [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)).

You **always** have to import the `index.css` file.  This contains the structural styles AdapTable requires and, also, the (default) Light theme:

```tsx
import "@adaptabletools/adaptable/index.css"
```

If you want to use the Dark theme, you will need, also, to import:

```tsx
import "@adaptabletools/adaptable/index.css" // always needed
import "@adaptabletools/adaptable/themes/dark.css"
```

To find out how to your write your custom themes, provide custom icons - and about AdapTable styling generally - please read the [Adaptable Theming and Styling Guide](../../packages/adaptable/readme/guides/adaptable-theming-guide.md)

## HTML Rendering

The core version of AdapTable expects you to create in your HTML 2 `Div`s:

- one for AdapTable (with the id of 'adaptable') 

- one for the underlying grid (with the id of 'grid').

So your HTML should look like this: 
  
```html

<body>
  ......
  <div id="adaptable"></div>
  <div id="grid"></div>
  .....
</body>

```
## Adaptable State

AdapTable will manage the persistence of all Adaptable (ie. User) State.  This takes 2 forms:  

- **Predefined Config** - State created at design-time and given to AdapTable so that at first-time use of the application, the user has everything he or she needs to get started.

- **State Management** - Ensuring that all changes made by the user at run-time are saved and persisted to an appropriate location so they are available the next time the system runs.

For more information please read the [Adaptable State Guide](../../packages/adaptable/readme/guides/adaptable-state-guide.md)

## Instantiation

You create an instance of AdapTable by providing a static constructor with an [AdaptableOptions](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_adaptableoptions_.adaptableoptions.html) object.

The constructor will return an [Adaptable API](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_api_adaptableapi_.adaptableapi) object that you can use to access all features of AdapTable at runtime:

```ts
const api: AdaptableApi = Adaptable.init(adaptableOptions)
```


## Basic Example

```html
<body>
  ......
  <div id="adaptable"></div>
  <div id="grid" className="ag-theme-balham"></div>
  .....
</body>
```

```tsx

// import Adaptable
import Adaptable from "@adaptabletools/adaptable/agGrid";

// import the Adaptable types
import { AdaptableOptions, AdaptableApi } from "@adaptabletools/adaptable/types";

// import Plugins
import charts from "@adaptabletools/adaptable-plugin-charts";
import finance from "@adaptabletools/adaptable-plugin-finance";

// import any Enterprise ag-Grid modules needed
import { MenuModule } from '@ag-grid-enterprise/menu';
import { RangeSelectionModule } from '@ag-grid-enterprise/range-selection';

// import AdapTable styles
import '@adaptabletools/adaptable/index.css'; // includes the light theme, which is the default
import '@adaptabletools/adaptable/themes/dark.css'; // if you want to use the dark theme

// import ag-Grid styles
import "@ag-grid-community/all-modules/dist/styles/ag-grid.css";
import "@ag-grid-community/all-modules/dist/styles/ag-theme-balham.css";
import "@ag-grid-community/all-modules/dist/styles/ag-theme-balham-dark.css";

// create column definitions
const columnDefs = [
  { field: "orderId", headerName: 'Order Id', type: "abColDefNumber" },
  { field: "companyName", headerName: 'Company', type: "abColDefString" },
  { field: "contactName", headerName: 'Contact', type: "abColDefString" },
  { field: "employeeName", headerName: 'Employee', type: "abColDefString" },
  { field: "invoicedCost", headerName: 'Invoiced Amount', type: "abColDefNumber" }
];

// Create an underlying vendor Grid instance 
// in this example we are using ag-Grid which has a GridOptions object
const gridOptions: GridOptions=  {
      columnDefs: columnDefs,
      rowData : [],
      enableRangeSelection: true,
      floatingFilter: true,
      sideBar: 'columns',
      columnTypes: {
        abColDefNumber: {},
        abColDefString: {},
        abColDefBoolean: {},
        abColDefDate: {},
        abColDefNumberArray: {},
        abColDefObject: {},
        abColDefCustom: {},
      },
    };
  }
  
 // Create an AdaptableOptions object which will include some basic properties
 // Set the vendorGrid property to our gridOptions object and attach any Enterprise modules to modules property
 // Also attach any Predefined Config we need for when AdapTable first starts up
 const adaptableOptions: AdaptableOptions = {
    primaryKey: 'orderId',
    userName: 'Demo User',
    adaptableId: 'readmeDemo',
    vendorGrid: {
      ...gridOptions,
      modules: [MenuModule, RangeSelectionModule],
     },
    predefinedConfig: demoConfig,
  };

  // Instantiate AdapTable with AdaptableOptions and recieve an AdaptableApi object for later use
  const adaptableApi: AdaptableApi = Adaptable.init(adaptableOptions);
  
  // We can now use the API to manage AdapTable and listen to Adaptable events, e.g.
 api.eventApi.on('AdaptableReady', () => {
    // perform anything you need to do when AdapTable is ready
  });
  
```
