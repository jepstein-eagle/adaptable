# AdapTable Licences FAQ

**Do we need a licence to do a Trial?**

Yes. There is no charge for an initial limited short-term trial licence but you do need to get in touch so that we can provide you with the keys needed to access to AdapTable's rich functionality.  

If you want to do a longer-term POC then you will need to agree a commercial Trial Licence. The cost of this is fully redeemable against purchase of an AdapTable Licence.

**How much do licences cost?**

It depends on how many users there are, and whether AdapTable is to be used across a single application or multiple applications. We sell bundles of licences and operate a sliding scale, so the more users you have the lower the cost per user with the cost per user falling rapidly.

We also offer a Universal Licence giving unlimited usage for unlimited users which can be more appropriate in some situations.

**We are a software company so we don't know how many end users we will have. Is there a model that works for us?.**

Yes:  We offer a Universal Licence for software houses and similar clients who are unable to provide us with a precise number of end users. In this scenario, we set a fixed annual price that allows for unlimited usage (and unlimited users).

**How long does a licence last?**

One year from when it is signed.  It is also possible to agree a multi-year licence and/or pricing formula where there is a desire for greater certainty and a willingness to commit.

At the end of the licence period, if you choose not to renew AdapTable will continue to work but there will no longer be eligibility for updates or Support.

**Does that include updates?**

Yes, we guarantee a minimum of 4 quarterly updates a year which continue to expand the functionality available.

**Does a licence include Support? And if so, how much?**

We provide Support through email (support@adaptabletools.com) and [Zendesk](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and aim to respond to all queries within 12 hours.  

**What happens if an underlying grid releases a new version? Does the licence cover that?**

We guarantee to support any major release of an underlying vendor grid within 30 days of its release. We try to ensure backward compatibility but obviously if there are breaking changes then we will support only the newest version.


## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007083017-Help-) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
