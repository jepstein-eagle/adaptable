# AdapTable Team Sharing Guide
Team Sharing allows users to share - at run-time - Adaptable Objects between colleagues.

It is designed for use cases where the same, newly-created Adaptable Object (e.g. a Layout, Conditional Style, Advanced Search, Report etc.) will be required by multiple users.

## Enabling Team Sharing
For Team Sharing to be available both of the following must be set up:

1. the `enableTeamSharing` property must be set to true in [TeamSharingOptions](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html#enableteamsharing)

2. the Team Sharing Function must have its [Entitlement](./adaptable-entitlements-guide.md) set to 'Full'

## How It Works
The workflow is simple (based on a pull operation):

1. A User creates a new Layout

2. In the Layouts Popup an orange *Team Share* button will appear in the row for the Layout (if Team Sharing is [enabled](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html))

3. After this button is clicked, the Layout will be in the Team Sharing collection (available for download by colleagues)

4. Any colleague can now open the Team Sharing Popup (which lists all available Adaptable Objects that have been shared) and click to download the Layout created in Step 1.

## Team Sharing Functions
Setting up Team Sharing requires the provision at design-time of 2 functions (both of which return Promises, and both of which are supplied through [Team Sharing Options](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html)):

 - **[getSharedEntities](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html#getsharedentities)**: retrieves any available Shared Entities that the user is able to download (and which AdapTable will then merge automatically with his Adaptable State)

 - **[setSharedEntities](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html#setsharedentities)**: saves (essentially uploads) Shared Entities so they can be downloaded (and re-used) by other members of the team

 ```ts

 teamSharingOptions: {
     enableTeamSharing: true,
      async getSharedEntities(adaptableId) {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
          const sharedEntities = JSON.parse(
            localStorage.getItem(`TEAM_SHARING:${adaptableId}`) || '[]'
          );
          resolve(sharedEntities);
        });
      },
      async setSharedEntities(adaptableId, sharedEntities) {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
          localStorage.setItem(`TEAM_SHARING:${adaptableId}`, JSON.stringify(sharedEntities));
          resolve();
        });
      },
    }

 ```

## FAQ

**Can we turn off Team Sharing if we don't want to use it?**

You don't need to turn off Team Sharing as its not available by default. 

Team Sharing is only available if the `enableTeamSharing` property is set to true in [Team Sharing Options](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_adaptableoptions_teamsharingoptions_.teamsharingoptions.html) and the Function Entitlement for the Team Sharing Function is 'Full'.

**Can we share Adaptable Objects between different Adaptable instances?**

No.  Team Sharing is designed to be used only for instances that share a single `AdaptableId`; e.g. all users of a CDS Pricer can share the same Report but it cannot also be used in a Bond Matrix Pricer.
