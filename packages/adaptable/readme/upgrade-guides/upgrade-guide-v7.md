## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007083017-Help-) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
