# AdapTable Version 7 Upgrade Guide

Version 7 of AdapTable will be released end of May.

It has some changes of interest:

## New ag-Grid Version (23)

Note formatted value expression and column filter dropdown 

By default, column filters looked very similar to aggrid 22 balham theme, since `filterOptions.useVendorFilterFormStyle` was default to `true`. With the transition to v23, even with `filterOptions.useVendorFilterFormStyle` set to `true`, the styles now look more modern and similar to the aggrid `alpine` theme, which aggrid recommends as default.

## CSS Variables

Added `--ab-cmp-field-wrap__border-radius` css variable
