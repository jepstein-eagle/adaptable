# Calculated Column (AdaptableFunction)

The Calculated Column ([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `CalculatedColumn`) enables the creation of special 'user-defined' columns which contain a custom 'Expression' which is evaluated at design-time per row.

> Calculated Columns can either be provided at design-time (through `CalculatedColumns` in [Predefined Config](https://api.adaptabletools.com/interfaces/_src_predefinedconfig_calculatedcolumnstate_.calculatedcolumnstate.html)) or at run-time through the UI (if Entitlements allow).

Unlike 'regular' columns, Calculated Columns **do not store data** and are not part of your underlying grid's Data Source.

Calculated Columns can either be static (i.e. show a single value) or dynamic (i.e. based on other columns in the row).

There are numerous potential uses for Calculated Columns including showing Historical Data, and allowing you to do 'what if' or scenario analysis by copying some columns and see what happens if you change their values.

## Calculated Column Expression

Calculated Columns include an **Expression** that users provide. 

An Expression typically includes a mathematical operator and will reference other columns. 

> There is a huge array of potential mathematical operators that you can use to create your Expression.  (We use the [Math.JS](https://mathjs.org/) library to evaluate the Expression).  

> An Expression can include as many operators as required: there is no limit on the number of operators or the number of other columns that can be referenced.

Note: The Expression in the Calculated Column updates in real time as values in the columns to which it refers change.

## Calculated Column Expression Examples
There is not currently a GUI to help you write Calculated Column Expressions - though one will be released soon.  

So for the time being they need to be written by hand.

The key thing to note is that columns are referenced in the Expression as Col("ColumnName"), e.g. Col("Bid").  

> You can use either the column's field name, i.e. the identifier for the column used by the underlying grid - e.g. Col("orderId"); or you can use the Column's Friendly Name, i.e. the Caption displayed in the Header row - e.g. Col("Order ID").

To create an Expression which references another column and a mathematical operator: 

```
Col("Notional") * 2
 ```      

To create an Expression which references 2 columns:

```
Col("ItemCost") / Col("ItemCount")
 ```      

To create an Expression which references 3 columns:

```
ColumnExpression: Col("InvoicedCost") - ( Col("OrderCost") + Col("PackageCost"))
 ```      

To create an Expression which multiplies many columns:

```
multiply(Col("OrderCost") , Col("ItemCost"), Col("PackageCost"))
 ```
 
To create an Expression which uses ternary (if) logic (and outputs a string):

```
Col("ItemCost") > 100 ? "High" : Col("ItemCost") > 50 ? "Medium": "Low"
 ``` 

To create an Expression which returns the highest of 4 Columns in the row (great for things like MiFID):

```
max(Col("ItemCost"), Col("OrderCost"), Col("InvoicedCost"), (Col("PackageCost")*10))
 ```

To create an Expression which mixes strings and numbers and formats the result (here to 2 decimal places):

```
print("(20% VAT): $tax", {tax: (Col("OrderCost")*0.2).toFixed(2)} ),
 ```
 
## UI Elements

Calculated Column includes the following UI Elements:

- **Popup** - Shows a list of existing Calculated Columns with Edit and Delete buttons.  Plus an Add button to start the Calculated Column Wizard.

- **Wizard** - A series of steps facilitating the creation and editing of Calculated Columns.

- **Column Menu** - `Edit Calculated Column` Menu Item opens the Calculated Column wizard (only visible if that column is a Calculated Column).

## Entitlements

Calculated Column supports these Entitlement Rules:

- **Full**: Everything is available to the User

- **Hidden**: Everything is hidden from the User

- **ReadOnly**: User can see Calculated Columns defined in Predefined Config but not add, edit or delete them.

## FAQ

**Which mathematical operators can we use to build the Expression?**

You can use any of the hundreds available in the [Math.JS](https://mathjs.org/) library.

**Its quite cumbersome to have to write the Expression by hand.  Is there a GUI option?**

Not at present but it is on the To Do list and will be in a future release.  We anticipate that you will be able to drag and drop the columns and choose the operators from a dropdown.

**Can I include more than one operator in an Expression?**

Yes, you can include as many operators as you wish in an Expression. Some users have written Expressions that contain 4 or more operators.

**Can I use the Calculated Column in other Queries?**

Yes, once the Calculated Column is created, then its treated the same as any other column and can be used in Queries and Adaptable Objects.

**Can I edit the value a Calculated Column directly?**

No, a Calculated Column is readonly. You can edit the Expression but cannot edit one of the cells in the column itself.

**Can I create a Calculated Column that returns a string?**

Yes, your Calculated Column can return a number, string, date or boolean. AdapTable will work out the datatype of the Calculated Column automatically, so that the created Column is treated like any other Column in queries and Expressions.

**Can I change the name of a Calculated Column?**

You can and the change will persist.  However please note that AdapTable will not update any layouts or other objects (e.g. filters) that reference this Calculated Column so be very careful before changing the name of a Calculated Column that is used elsewhere.
