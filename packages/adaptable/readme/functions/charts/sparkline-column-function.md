# Sparkline Column (AdaptableFunction)

The Sparkline Column([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `SparklineColumn`) Function enables the creation of special Columns that will display cell contents as a Sparkline.

Sparkline Columns are special columns where you can see an array of data as a Sparkline.

They are particularly useful if you have pricing or historical data.

You can choose how the Sparkline will appear visually.

Warning
By their nature Sparkline columns require more intensive rendering than normal columns so use sparingly or take into account the extra time it will take to render the Sparkline.

## FAQ

Can I create a Sparkline Column at runtime?

No, you cannot. They can only be created at design time as they only work on columns which contain an array of number values.

For the same reason you cannot delete a Sparkline column at runtime (but you can edit one).
