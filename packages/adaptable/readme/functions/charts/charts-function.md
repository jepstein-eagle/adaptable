# Chart (AdaptableFunction)

The Chart([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `PieChart`) Function provides a large number of powerful charting options (courtesy of Infragistics).

Category Charts

Category Charts are charts that let you see data in a typical X and Y axis form.

In the Category Chart wizard you need to select:

One or more Y Axis (Vertical) Columns (numeric only)

An X Axis (Horizontal) Column

Note
You can create a Query to reduce the number of values retrieved in the X Axis (see Queries for more details on creating queries).

Name and (optional) Description

Tip
There are a huge amount of different options and properties you can set for Category Charts including Chart Type (e.g. column, line etc), Annotations, Callouts, Transitions and much else.

Pie Charts

This function allows you to see the contents of a Column in Pie or Doughnut Chart form.

In the Pie Chart wizard you need to select:

Primary Column

Secondary Column (optional)

Name and (optional) Description

You can choose whether to see the chart as Pie Chart or Doughnut. You are also able to specify 'Others' to group together the smallest set of values.

Tip
As well as being able to create a saveable Pie Chart, you are also able to see a whole column as a Pie Chart (via the Column Header menu) or a range of selected cells (via the Context menu).

Note
If there are too many values to view individually (e.g. if its a numeric column) then AdapTable will group the values into ranges for you.

Sparklines

Sparklines are ideal for seeing data as a range.

Tip
Like with Pie Charts, as well as being able to create a saveable Sparkline, you are also able to see a whole column as a Sparkline (via the Column Header menu) or a range of selected cells (via the Context menu).

You can choose whether to see the Sparkline as Line, Column or Area.

## FAQ


How many Charts Type are there?

Currently 2 (Category and Doughnut) but more to come in due course.

The Charts package is very large - can I avoid using and downloading it?

Yes, Charting as of Version 6 (January 2020) is provided as an Adaptable Plugin; so if you don't want to use Charting then simply don't request the Charting Plugin.
