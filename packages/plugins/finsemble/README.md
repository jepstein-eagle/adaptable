# AdapTable Finsemble Plugin Read Me

This plugin is designed for using AdapTable inside [Finsemble](https://www.chartiq.com/finsemble/).

> Note: As of Version 7 there is no meaningful functionality in this plugin (unlike for ipushpull, OpenFin and Glue42 plugins).  However, it will be added in the near future so the plugin was created in order to facilitate this.

## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007083017-Help-) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
