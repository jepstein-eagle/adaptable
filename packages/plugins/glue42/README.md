# AdapTable Glue42 Plugin Read Me

Designed for when AdapTable will be used on a desktop also running [Glue42](https://glue42.com/).

This plugin leverages many of the powerful features of Glue42 to offer users additional options such as Audited, Validated 2 way export between AdapTable and Excel. 

For instance you can export data to Excel via Glue42, and any edits made by users in Excel will be sent back to AdapTable (so the 2 remain in sync) and will be subject to any validation rules that have been created in AdapTable.  This ensures that data in Excel are not only validated but (thanks to [Audit Log](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/guides/adaptable-audit-log-guide.md)) also fully audited.

## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007083017-Help-) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
