Repository for the Adaptable Blotter HTML5 version - AdaptableBlotter.JS - developed by Adaptable Tools.

AdaptableBlotter.JS is a powerful DataGrid add-on that integrates with the leading datagrid components and provides all the additional, rich functionality that financial and other advanced users expect from their grids and blotters.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality.  It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital in the current regulatory and compliance environment.  Try it out for yourself at http://demo.adaptableblotter.com.
